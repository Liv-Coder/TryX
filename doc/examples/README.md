# Tryx Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating various usage patterns of the Tryx library.

## Basic Examples

### [Basic Usage](basic_usage.dart)

Simple examples showing the fundamental concepts of Tryx.

### [Error Handling](error_handling.dart)

Different approaches to handling errors with custom error types.

### [Method Chaining](method_chaining.dart)

Functional programming patterns with map, flatMap, and other operations.

## Advanced Examples

### [Async Operations](async_operations.dart)

Working with asynchronous operations and Future<Result>.

### [Stream Processing](stream_processing.dart)

Using Tryx with streams for reactive programming.

### [Retry and Timeout](retry_timeout.dart)

Advanced configuration with retry policies and timeouts.

### [Global Configuration](global_config.dart)

Setting up system-wide configuration and logging.

## Real-World Examples

### [API Client](api_client.dart)

Building a robust API client with proper error handling.

### [File Operations](file_operations.dart)

Safe file I/O operations with fallback strategies.

### [Database Operations](database_operations.dart)

Database queries with connection pooling and error recovery.

### [Form Validation](form_validation.dart)

User input validation with detailed error reporting.

## Integration Examples

## Migration Examples

### [Before and After](migration_examples.dart)

Side-by-side comparisons of try-catch vs Tryx patterns.

## Running Examples

Each example is a complete Dart program that can be run independently:

```bash
dart run doc/examples/basic_usage.dart
dart run doc/examples/api_client.dart
# etc.
```
