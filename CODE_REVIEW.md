# Tryx Code Review

## Overall Summary

The `Tryx` library is a well-designed and robust solution for functional error handling in Dart. It demonstrates a strong commitment to modern language features, clean architecture, and comprehensive documentation. The API is expressive and intuitive, especially for developers familiar with functional programming concepts.

The primary strengths are:

- **Clean Architecture:** The use of a sealed `Result` class is an excellent foundation. The separation of concerns between core types, safe functions, and extensions is logical and maintainable.
- **Developer Experience:** The library is easy to use, with a fluent API and excellent inline documentation that enhances discoverability.
- **Modern Dart:** The code effectively uses modern Dart features like sealed classes, extension methods, and pattern matching, resulting in a clean and expressive codebase.

The main areas for improvement are centered on enhancing type safety in edge cases, improving performance by reducing unnecessary object allocations, and refining the API to be even more consistent and intuitive.

## Critical Issues (Must-Fix)

### 1. Unhandled `TypeError` in `safeWith` When No `errorMapper` is Provided

- **Description:** The `safeWith` function is intended to safely capture errors, but it throws a `TypeError` if an exception occurs that does not match the expected error type `E` and no `errorMapper` is supplied. This violates the core promise of the library, as it leads to an uncaught exception in a scenario where the developer expects a `Failure` result.
- **File:** `lib/src/functions/safe.dart`
- **Relevant Lines:** 121-128
- **Before:**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/functions/safe.dart:121-128

        // If no error mapper is provided, try to cast the error to E
        if (error is E) {
          return Result.failure(error);
        } else {
          // If the error can't be cast to E, this is a programming error
          throw TypeError();
        }
  ```

- **After:**

  ```dart
        // If no error mapper is provided, try to cast the error to E
        if (error is E) {
          return Result.failure(error);
        } else {
          // If the error can't be cast to E, wrap it in a fallback
          // exception to avoid an unhandled TypeError. This will succeed
          // if E is a top-level type like `Exception` or `Object`.
          final unhandledException = Exception(
              'Caught an error of type ${error.runtimeType}, but expected type $E.');
          return Result.failure(unhandledException as E);
        }
  ```

- **Why:** The fundamental purpose of `safeWith` is to prevent uncaught exceptions. The original implementation breaks this rule. The corrected version captures the unexpected error, wraps it in a generic `Exception`, and returns it as a `Failure`. This makes the function's behavior predictable and resilient, ensuring that the application does not crash from an unexpected error type. The `as E` cast is a pragmatic solution that works when `E` is a supertype like `Exception` or `Object`, which covers the vast majority of use cases.

## Suggestions for Improvement (Should-Fix)

### 1. Performance: Override `isSuccess`/`isFailure` in `Success` and `Failure` Classes

- **Description:** The `isSuccess` and `isFailure` getters in the base `Result` class use a `switch` expression. While modern Dart compilers are highly optimized, providing direct `true`/`false` overrides in the concrete `Success` and `Failure` classes is more explicit and can lead to minor performance improvements by avoiding the switch overhead.
- **File:** `lib/src/core/result.dart`
- **Relevant Lines:** 131 & 163
- **Before (`Success` class):**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/core/result.dart:130-136 (No override)
  final class Success<T, E extends Object> extends Result<T, E> {
    // ...
    @override
    bool get isSuccess => true; // Already correct, but isFailure is missing

    @override
    bool get isFailure => false; // Already correct
  }
  ```

- **After (`Success` class):**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/core/result.dart
  final class Success<T, E extends Object> extends Result<T, E> {
    // ...
    @override
    bool get isSuccess => true;

    @override
    bool get isFailure => false;
  }
  ```

- **Why:** This change makes the implementation more direct and removes any potential overhead from the `switch` expression in the base class. It also improves the clarity of the concrete classes by making their boolean states explicit. A similar change should be applied to the `Failure` class (`isSuccess: false`, `isFailure: true`).

### 2. API Design: Deprecate Nullable `value` and `error` Getters on Base `Result`

- **Description:** The base `Result` class exposes nullable `value` and `error` getters. While convenient, this can lead to anti-patterns where developers directly access `.value` and perform null checks, which is what this library is designed to avoid. Deprecating these getters encourages the use of safer, more explicit methods like `when`, `getOrNull`, or `getOrElse`.
- **File:** `lib/src/core/result.dart`
- **Relevant Lines:** 63 & 78
- **Before:**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/core/result.dart:63-66
    T? get value => switch (this) {
      Success(value: final v) => v,
      Failure() => null,
    };
  ```

- **After:**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/core/result.dart
    @Deprecated('Use `when`, `getOrNull`, or other explicit methods instead. This will be removed in a future version.')
    T? get value => switch (this) {
      Success(value: final v) => v,
      Failure() => null,
    };
  ```

- **Why:** Guiding developers toward the functional and explicit API (`when`, `fold`, `getOrElse`) reinforces the library's core principles. Deprecating the nullable getters serves as a strong signal to avoid imperative null-checking and embrace a more robust, functional style of error handling.

### 3. Consistency: Redundant `await` on `Future.value` in `Safe.call`

- **Description:** In the `Safe.call` method, `Future.value(fn())` is used to wrap a potentially synchronous function `fn` into a `Future`. However, the result is immediately awaited. This is unnecessary since `fn` is guaranteed to be a `FutureOr<T>`. We can simplify this by awaiting `fn()` directly.
- **File:** `lib/src/advanced/safe_class.dart`
- **Relevant Lines:** 215 & 217
- **Before:**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/advanced/safe_class.dart:215-218
          result = await Future.value(fn()).timeout(timeout!);
        } else {
          result = await Future.value(fn());
        }
  ```

- **After:**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/advanced/safe_class.dart
          result = await Future.sync(fn).timeout(timeout!);
        } else {
          result = await Future.sync(fn);
        }
  ```

- **Why:** Using `Future.sync(fn)` is the idiomatic way to handle a `FutureOr<T> Function()` in Dart. It executes the function and, if it returns a `Future`, waits for it to complete. This is cleaner and more direct than wrapping with `Future.value` and then immediately awaiting.

## Nitpicks & Minor Comments (Could-Fix)

### 1. Readability: Unnecessary Circular Import in `tryx.dart`

- **Description:** The main library file, `lib/tryx.dart`, contains an unnecessary import of itself: `import 'package:tryx/tryx.dart'`. This import is redundant and can be safely removed.
- **File:** `lib/tryx.dart`
- **Relevant Lines:** 96-97
- **Before:**

  ```dart
  // lib/tryx.dart:96-97
  import 'package:tryx/tryx.dart'
      show Result, Success, Failure, SafeResult, ResultExtensions;
  ```

- **After:**

  ```dart
  // (Line removed)
  ```

- **Why:** Removing circular or redundant imports is a standard code hygiene practice that improves maintainability and reduces potential confusion.

### 2. Documentation: Clarify `_convertToException` StackTrace Parameter

- **Description:** The documentation for the `_convertToException` function mentions that the `stackTrace` parameter is "reserved for future enhancements". This is slightly ambiguous. The comment should be updated to clarify its purpose or be removed if there are no concrete plans for its use.
- **File:** `lib/src/functions/safe.dart`
- **Relevant Lines:** 138-140
- **Before:**

  ```dart
  // lib/src/functions/safe.dart:138-140
  /// The [stackTrace] parameter is currently unused but reserved for
  /// future enhancements that might include stack trace information
  /// in the exception.
  ```

- **After:**

  ```dart
  /// The [stackTrace] parameter is included to match the signature of a
  /// standard catch block, allowing for future integration with logging
  /// or error reporting systems that require stack traces.
  ```

- **Why:** Clear, precise documentation helps developers understand the design decisions behind the code. The updated comment provides a more concrete reason for the parameter's existence.
